The national flag of Denmark (Danish: Dannebrog, pronounced [ˈtænəˌpʁoˀ])[2] is red with a white Nordic cross, which means that the cross extends to the edges of the flag and the vertical part of the cross is shifted to the hoist side.

A banner with a white-on-red cross is attested as having been used by the kings of Denmark since the 14th century.[3] An origin legend with considerable impact on Danish national historiography connects the introduction of the flag to the Battle of Lindanise of 1219.[4] The elongated Nordic cross reflects the use as a maritime flag in the 18th century.[5] The flag became popular as a national flag in the early 16th century. Its private use was outlawed in 1834, but again permitted by a regulation of 1854. The flag holds the world record of being the oldest continuously used national flag.[1]
