The national flag of Greece, popularly referred to as the "blue and white one" (Greek: Γαλανόλευκη, Galanólefki) or the "sky blue and white" (Κυανόλευκη, Kyanólefki), is officially recognised by Greece as one of its national symbols and has nine equal horizontal stripes of blue alternating with white. There is a blue canton in the upper hoist-side corner bearing a white cross; the cross symbolises Eastern Orthodox Christianity, the prevailing metaphysical worldview in Greece; thus it is a nonsecular national flag . The blazon of the flag is Azure, four bars Argent; on a canton of the field a Greek cross throughout of the second. The official flag ratio is 2:3.[1] The shade of blue used in the flag has varied throughout its history, from light blue to dark blue, the latter being increasingly used since the late 1960s. It was officially adopted by the First National Assembly at Epidaurus on 13 January 1822.

The nine stripes do not have any official meaning; the most popular theory says that they represent the syllables of the phrase Ελευθερία ή Θάνατος ("Freedom or Death"), the five blue stripes for the syllables Ελευθερία and the four white stripes ή Θάνατος.[2] The nine stripes is also said to represent the letters of the word "freedom" (Greek: ελευθερία).[2]

White and blue symbolise the colours of the Greek sky and sea.[3]
